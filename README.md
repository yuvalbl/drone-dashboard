## Scenario - Drone movement track simulation

Data is of 2 types of entities: drones and pads
Each pad is a place for a drone to charging. Pad have 2 drone spots
Drones traveling around from pad to pad (randomly selected). they are either landing and charging or - moving to next pad destination

Data is changing on interval - "round"
On each round a drone is on movement - it's fuel is reduce (by 0.01)
On each round a drone landed on a pad spot - it's battery is increasing (charging)
